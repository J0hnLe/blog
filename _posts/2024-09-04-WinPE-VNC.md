# Empowering WinPE with a Browser-Based VNC

Hey tech enthusiasts! If you’re into tweaking and optimizing system environments, you’re in for a treat. Today, we’re diving into a cool project that integrates a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server into the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE). This setup uses NoVNC, Websockify (powered by Node.js), and a Python-based HTTP server to make remote management a breeze. Let’s get into the details and see how you can supercharge your WinPE environment!

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/9-5/WinPE-VNC)

## What’s the Deal?

The WinPE VNC Server Project is all about setting up a VNC server within WinPE, enabling you to control systems remotely. The project builds on an older guide by [sjkingo/winpe_vnc](https://github.com/sjkingo/winpe_vnc), but it’s been updated for today’s tech. This setup allows you to access a browser-based VNC client from anywhere on your local network—or even beyond, with a bit of port forwarding.

## Disclaimer

A quick heads-up: This project is shared as-is. While it’s designed to work, I can’t take responsibility for any mishaps—like your local IT getting annoyed if you port-forward the VNC server, or any other unforeseen drama.

## What Can You Do with This?

- **Run a VNC Server in WinPE**: Access and control systems remotely while they’re running WinPE.
- **Use a Browser-Based VNC Client**: Connect from any modern web browser—super convenient!
- **Local Network Access**: Reach the VNC server within your local network. Port forwarding can give you access from anywhere.

## What You Need

Here’s the tech stack for this setup:

- **A Windows 10/11 system**: You’ll need a host system to build your WinPE environment.
- **Node.js**: For running Websockify.
- **Python 3.12**: This version was tested, but others might work.
- **TightVNC**: Essential for the VNC server functionality.

## How to Set It Up

### 1. Set Up WinPE

Start by creating your WinPE environment. Follow [Microsoft’s official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/download-winpe--windows-pe?view=windows-11) and place your build files in `C:\WinPE\`.

### 2. Mount the WinPE Image

You’ll need to mount the `boot.wim` file to make changes:
```batch
DISM /Mount-Image /ImageFile:C:\WinPE\media\sources\boot.wim /MountDir:C:\WinPE\mount /Index:1
```

### 3. Install TightVNC

Download and install [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php). Configure it as a system service, set a password (if desired), and adjust the port if needed (default is 5900).

### 4. Export TightVNC Config

Grab the necessary registry keys and files:
```batch
mkdir C:\VNC
reg export "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TightVNC" C:\VNC\vnc.reg
copy C:\Program Files\TightVNC\*.* C:\VNC\
```

### 5. Prepare Server Files

Get the project files from this repository or download pre-built executables and extract them to `C:\VNC\`. Make sure you have a server folder in `C:\VNC\server\`.

### 6. Install Node.js and Python Dependencies

Install the tools you'll need:
```batch
pip install PyInstaller
npm install --save @maximegris/node-websockify
npm install pkg
```

### 7. Build Standalone Executables

Create standalone executables for WinPE:
```batch
python -m PyInstaller --onefile C:\VNC\server\winpe_httpserver.py
pkg -t node*-win-x64 C:\VNC\winpe_vnc.js
```

### 8. Copy Files to WinPE

Move `C:\VNC` to `C:\WinPE\mount\Windows\`.

### 9. Add NirCMD

Download NirCMD and put `nircmd.exe` in `C:\WinPE\mount\Windows\System32\`.

### 10. Configure Startnet.cmd

Update `C:\WinPE\mount\Windows\System32\startnet.cmd` to auto-launch VNC components:
```batch
@echo off
wpeinit >nul 2>&1
wpeutil InitializeNetwork
wpeutil DisableFirewall
powercfg /s 8c5e7fda-e8bf-4a96-9a85-a6e23a8c635c
cd X:\
regedit /s X:\Windows\VNC\vnc.reg
X:\Windows\VNC\tvnserver.exe -install -silent
X:\Windows\VNC\tvnserver.exe -start
X:\Windows\System32\nircmd.exe exec hide "X:\Windows\VNC\winpe_vnc.exe"
cd X:\Windows\VNC\server
X:\Windows\System32\nircmd.exe exec hide "winpe_httpserver.exe"
cd X:\
ipconfig
```

### 11. Finalize

Close everything and unmount the WinPE image:
```batch
DISM /Unmount-WIM /MountDir:C:\WinPE\mount /Commit
```

Now, you can write the WinPE image to a USB drive or HDD. Check out [Microsoft’s guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/winpe-create-usb-bootable-drive?view=windows-11#create-a-winpe-iso-dvd-or-cd) and [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) for making a bootable drive.

## Using Your Setup

When you boot into WinPE, `startnet.cmd` will set up everything for you. Find the IPv4 address using ipconfig and connect via a web browser:
```
http://[IP ADDRESS]:[PORT (DEFAULT=8000)/#host=[IP ADDRESS]&port=[PORT (DEFAULT=8113)]
```

Example:
```
http://192.168.0.100:8000/#host=192.168.0.100&port=8113
```

By default, the winpe_httpserver serves the http server via port 8000, but a port can be specified using `\path\to\winpe_httpserver.exe [PORT NUMBER]`. For instance, `C:\VNC\winpe_httpserver.exe 80` will remove the need of specifying the port in the URL when accessing the VNC client. (Final URL would be something like `http://192.168.0.100/#host=192.168.0.100&port=192.168.0.100`
